-March 11th of 2020 was the end of my nearly 20 year career as an audio engineer for concerts & events. Covid burned the industry to the ground and, it WILL come back, but I have worked a LOT with digital audio formats, codecs, global word clock settings, hardware, making two or more units "talk" to each other, etc.

I want to do this. My good friend Kiel Dehnert completed Turing's program in 2018. I watched from his start until now, as he turned into a more confident, determined, and happy person who loves their job!
