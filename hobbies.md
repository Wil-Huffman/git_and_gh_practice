My hobbies include:

-Reading

I listen to audiobooks pretty much all the time that I'm doing things around the apartment or elsewhere. I have "read" almost 30 books since January 1. I listen at 1.4x speed, so they move more quickly. I can't seem to go any faster than that and comprehend the material.

-Playing guitar

(almost exclusively acoustic guitar, as i live in an apartment)

-Lock picking

I spent $50 on a set of picks & bars years ago and I often pick padlocks in my lap while i'm doing something passive, like watching something on a screen. It's easy to acquire padlocks, both with the keys and without, for free.

-It's not a hobby for me, per say, but I love getting my daughter into all sorts of hobbies. I boxed for a while, and we enjoy working on form, technique, and just goofing around.
